# Smart-Home-System-Simulator

This is a dream house simulator, better than mine at least. For this project I have used Python and an OOP aproach to build it. This Smart Home System Simulator lets you manage virtual smart devices like lights, thermostats, and doors within different rooms. And yes, you can also create user accounts to control these devices. 

## Features

### Device Management:

Device: The base class for all your virtual devices. You can turn them on or off and check their status in case you want to double-check if your virtual light is really off.

Lights: Extends Device. You can change the color and brightness. 

Thermostat: Extends Device. Set and get the temperature.

Door: Extends Device. Lock and unlock doors.

### Room Management:

Room: Manage a collection of devices in a room. Add, remove, and control your devices. 

### User Management:

User: Handles user information and permissions. 

UserManagement: Create user accounts, log in, and manage users.
